### WGCNA for RNAseq data
This repositories introduce my opinioin of how to use WGCNA package. Most information posted here is from this official [WGCNA website]( https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/index.html).
In that website, *Tutorials* part contains all the R script one needed to install and run WGNCA. *FAQ: Problems installing or using the package* part contains some details of how to choose parameters based on the network you want to build.
